# Cleanup Plan After Reorganization

Once testing confirms that the reorganized structure works correctly, follow these steps to clean up the codebase:

## 1. Backup Original Structure

Before removing any files:

```bash
# Create a backup of the original app directory
mkdir -p backup
cp -r app backup/
```

## 2. Remove Old Files

```bash
# Remove the original app directory
rm -rf app

# Remove any temporary files created during reorganization
rm -f test-reorganization.js
```

## 3. Update Documentation

- Update README.md to reflect the new structure
- Remove any outdated documentation references
- Ensure all docs point to the correct new paths

## 4. Update CI/CD Configuration

- Update any CI/CD scripts to work with the new structure
- Update deployment workflows if necessary

## 5. Update Dependencies

```bash
# Install any missing dependencies in frontend
cd frontend
yarn

# Install any missing dependencies in backend
cd ../backend
yarn
```

## 6. Final Verification

```bash
# Ensure the application builds correctly
yarn build

# Run tests if available
yarn test

# Start the application in development mode to verify
yarn dev
```

## 7. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete frontend/backend reorganization and cleanup"
```

## Additional Notes

- The application should function identically before and after reorganization
- If any issues are found, refer to the backup or version control history
- Document any lessons learned during this reorganization process
