# Project Reorganization Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Created Frontend/Backend Structure**
   - Separated code into frontend and backend directories
   - Set up proper Next.js App Router structure in frontend
   - Created backend API structure with route organization

2. **Updated File Structure**
   - Moved UI components to frontend/components
   - Moved utility files to their respective directories
   - Moved API routes to backend directory
   - Created proper import path structures

3. **Updated Configuration**
   - Created separate package.json files for frontend and backend
   - Created separate tsconfig.json files with proper path mappings
   - Updated root configuration to recognize the new structure
   - Created yarn scripts for running each part separately

4. **Documentation**
   - Created STRUCTURE.md to document the new organization
   - Updated tasks.md to reflect completed reorganization
   - Created this summary document (REORGANIZATION.md)

## New Structure

The project now follows a clean separation between frontend and backend:

```
/
├── frontend/               # Next.js frontend application
│   ├── app/                # App Router pages and layouts
│   ├── components/         # React components
│   ├── utils/              # Frontend utilities
│   └── ...                 # Configuration files
│
├── backend/                # Backend API and server code
│   ├── api/                # API routes
│   ├── utils/              # Backend utilities
│   └── ...                 # Configuration files
│
├── docs/                   # Documentation
├── public/                 # Static assets
└── ...                     # Root configuration files
```

## How to Use

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run everything (frontend + backend)
yarn dev

# Run frontend only
yarn frontend:dev

# Run backend compilation in watch mode
yarn backend:dev
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Check types for the entire project
yarn typecheck
```

### Import Patterns

- Use `@/frontend/...` for importing frontend files
- Use `@/backend/...` for importing backend files

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration by testing the reorganized application
2. Remove the old app directory after confirming everything works
3. Consider further optimizations for the separated structure

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**
   - Frontend and backend code are clearly separated
   - Each part has its own configuration

2. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Easier to find and modify related code
   - Better organization for future features

3. **Enhanced Scalability**
   - Prepared for potential future full separation
   - Easier to deploy frontend and backend separately if needed

4. **Clear Import Paths**
   - Imports clearly indicate which part of the system the code belongs to
   - Reduced possibility of circular dependencies
