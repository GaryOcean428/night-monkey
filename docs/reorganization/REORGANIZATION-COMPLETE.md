# Frontend/Backend Reorganization Complete

The codebase has been successfully reorganized into a frontend/backend structure with the following benefits:

## New Structure

```
/
├── frontend/               # Next.js frontend application
│   ├── app/                # App Router pages and layouts
│   ├── components/         # React components
│   ├── utils/              # Frontend utilities
│   └── ...                 # Configuration files
│
├── backend/                # Backend API and server code
│   ├── api/                # API routes
│   ├── utils/              # Backend utilities
│   └── ...                 # Configuration files
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Frontend and backend code are now clearly separated
   - Each part has its own configuration and dependencies
   - Code organization follows modern best practices

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - It's now easier to locate related code
   - New developers can quickly understand the project structure
   - Changes to one part are less likely to affect the other

3. **Import Path Clarity**
   - All imports now use `@/frontend/` or `@/backend/` prefixes
   - This makes the code origin immediately obvious
   - Helps prevent accidental circular dependencies

## Next Steps

After this reorganization, the next tasks to focus on are:

1. Complete the deployment and testing setup (already in progress)
2. Implement the Agents SDK integration
3. Continue with the Realtime API implementation
4. Continue UI/UX enhancements

## Running the Application

The updated commands for running the application are:

```bash
# Start the entire application (frontend + backend)
npm run dev

# Start only the frontend
npm run frontend:dev

# Watch TypeScript compilation for backend
npm run backend:dev
```

All paths and import references have been updated, and the application should function identically to before the reorganization.
