# OpenAI Agents SDK

The Agents SDK provides a production-ready framework for building agentic AI applications with Python-first development.

## Core Components

### Agents
Agents are LLMs equipped with instructions and tools for specific tasks.

```python
from agents import Agent

support_agent = Agent(
    name="Support Agent",
    instructions="Help customers resolve technical issues",
    tools=[knowledge_base_tool, ticket_system_tool]
)
```

### Handoffs
Mechanism for inter-agent delegation, enabling complex workflows.

```python
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage",
    instructions="Route customer queries to the appropriate specialist",
    handoffs=[support_agent, billing_agent, sales_agent]
)
```

### Guardrails
Multi-layered validation system for ensuring safe and valid outputs.

```python
from agents import validation

agent = Agent(
    name="Financial Advisor",
    instructions="Provide financial guidance",
    guardrails=[
        validation.content_filter(),
        validation.output_schema(financial_advice_schema)
    ]
)
```

### Tracing
Built-in observability for debugging and performance monitoring.

```python
from agents import start_trace

with start_trace("customer_support_session"):
    agent.run("My account is locked, please help")
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Basic Agent Setup

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Define agent
assistant = Agent(
    name="Programming Assistant",
    instructions="Help users with coding questions"
)

# Synchronous execution
result = Runner.run_sync(assistant, "How do I use async/await in JavaScript?")

# Asynchronous execution
async def process_query():
    result = await Runner.run_async(assistant, "Explain promises in JavaScript")
    return result
```

### Custom Tool Creation

```python
from agents import function_tool

@function_tool
def search_database(query: str) -> list:
    """
    Search the company knowledge base for information.
    
    Args:
        query: The search term to look for
        
    Returns:
        List of relevant documents
    """
    # Database search implementation
    return relevant_docs
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

```python
# Define specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="Find information on topics"
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="Create well-written content"
)

# Orchestration
workflow_agent = Agent(
    name="Content Creator",
    instructions="Manage the content creation workflow",
    handoffs=[researcher, writer]
)

result = Runner.run_sync(
    workflow_agent, 
    "Create an article about AI advancements"
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection:**
   - Use GPT-4o for complex reasoning tasks
   - Consider GPT-o3 for advanced coding and math
   - Test with multiple models to find optimal performance

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement caching for repeated queries
   - Use asynchronous execution for parallel processing
   - Tune model parameters via ModelSettings

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors
   - Use structured error handling with try/except
   - Add logging for debugging agent workflows

4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Validate all inputs before processing
   - Limit agent capabilities using guardrails
   - Implement access controls for sensitive operations

## Integration with Responses API

The Agents SDK can be integrated with the Responses API for stateful conversations:

```python
from agents import Agent
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

agent = Agent(
    name="Customer Support",
    instructions="Assist customers with issues"
)

# Using Responses API to maintain state
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    input="I need help with my order",
    store=True
)

# Process with Agent SDK
result = agent.run(response.output_text)

# Continue conversation
followup = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    input="What's the status?",
    previous_response_id=response.id
)
```

## Enterprise Applications

- **Customer Support:** Automated ticket management
- **Financial Services:** Compliance-checked financial advice
- **Healthcare:** Medical information analysis
- **Education:** Personalized learning assistants
- **Legal:** Document review and analysis
