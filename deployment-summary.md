# Night Monkey Deployment Preparation Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Modified `next.config.mjs` to exclude docs folder from the build
   - Set output to 'standalone' for better Vercel compatibility

2. **Vercel Configuration**
   - Created `vercel.json` with optimal settings for deployment
   - Added security headers and build optimizations
   - Set up gitignore and PR/deployment rules

3. **Build Optimizations**
   - Created `.vercelignore` to exclude unnecessary files from deployment
   - Updated `.gitignore` with better comments (docs will remain tracked in git)

4. **Deployment Documentation**
   - Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` with comprehensive deployment instructions
   - Created `deploy-cli-commands.md` with useful Vercel CLI commands

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Setup Required**
   - Push these changes to your Git repository
   - Follow the deployment instructions in DEPLOYMENT.md
   - Set up environment variables in the Vercel dashboard

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set before deployment
   - Add other provider API keys as needed

3. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - Configure custom domain in Vercel dashboard
   - Set up DNS records as instructed by Vercel

4. **Testing**
   - After deployment, test all features
   - Verify the API connections are working correctly
   - Test function calling and tool usage

## Vercel Dashboard URL

Once you've deployed your application, you can manage it at:
https://vercel.com/dashboard

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:
1. Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure API keys have the correct permissions
4. Check the browser console for client-side errors

## Continuous Deployment

Your project is now set up for continuous deployment:
- Push to main branch will trigger automatic deployments
- Pull requests will create preview deployments
